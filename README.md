# cores
Synthetic molecular line profiles of model prestellar cores, calculated using a combination of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics, time-dependent chemistry, and radiative transfer, as described in Yin, Priestley & Wurster (2021). Profiles are given as numpy arrays of the intensity (K) versus velocity (km s-1) with respect to the rest frequency. File names indicate the physical model, orientation to the line of sight, and molecule - the CS line is the J=2-1 transition, all others are J=1-0.
